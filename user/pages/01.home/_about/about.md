Hello, I'm Terral and I currently work as a UI/UX designer and developer at Symplicity. While I am a web developer at heart, it is my background in graphic and user experience design that allows me to see the bigger picture. I believe that every successful project should effectively balance a user centered approach and a strong visual language. Great design doesn't happen by chance, but evolves out of planning and strategy. My goal is to construct effective roadmaps that lead users to the destinations they expect to reach. My passion for design and development is second only to the love I have for family. When I'm not working, you can find me grilling in the backyard, watching sports and spending time with my wife, 2 sons and our dog Champ.
